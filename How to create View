Definition: In SQL, a view is an alternative way of representing data that exists in one or more tables. Just like a real table, it contains rows and columns. 
The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
Though views can be queried like a table, views are dynamic; only the definition of the view is stored, not the data.

i. How does the syntax of a CREATE VIEW statement look?

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example:
CREATE VIEW EMPSALARY AS 
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, B_DATE, SEX, SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES; 

ii. How does the syntax of a REPLACE VIEW statement look?

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EMPSALARY  AS 
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, B_DATE, SEX, JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY, MAX_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES, JOBS
WHERE EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID = JOBS.JOB_IDENT;

SELECT * FROM EMPSALARY;                   		-------To display all data
